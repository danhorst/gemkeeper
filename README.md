# Gemkeeper

An opinionated wrapper around [Gem in a Box][1] for local, sandboxed Ruby development.

## Usage

This project can be run directly on your machine or in a Docker container.
For a local service, you'll need to install [Ruby][2], ideally with a [version manager][3].

## Colophon

This project has been augmented with [Claude Code][4].
The instructions for all agents are all in `AGENTS.md`.
There is a utility script (`bin/agent-setup`) that takes care of symlinking `AGENTS.md` to `CLAUDE.md`.
